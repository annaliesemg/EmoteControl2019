# EmoteControl

EmoteControl is an interface which allows for live-manipulation of six emotional cues in music: tempo, articulation, pitch, dynamics, brightness, and mode.

There are two versions of the interface: the full version and a smaller-scale version.
The full version of EmoteControl utilises Max/MSP, Logic Pro X, and Vienna Symphonic Library (VSL). The interface works with MIDI files inputted in the Max patch, and are played out through a chamber strings synth in the VSL plug-in in Logic. Five sliders and one toggle (on/off) button control the six cues that can be altered as the music plays in real-time. 

The smaller-scale version of EmoteControl also utilises Max/MSP and Logic Pro X, however, VSL is swapped with one of Logic's in-house virtual synths. This allows for the interface to work on smaller and less powerful devices. The 'portable' version works with a piano as playout. Four sliders and one toggle (on/off) button control the five cues (tempo, pitch, dynamics, brightness, and mode) that can be altered in the smaller-scale interface as the music plays in real-time.
