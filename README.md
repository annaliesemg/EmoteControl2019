# EmoteControl

EmoteControl is an interface which allows for live-manipulation of emotional cues in music.

EmoteControl V1.0: six musical cues can be changed. These are: tempo, articulation, pitch, dynamics, brightness, and mode.
EmoteControl V2.0: seven musical cues can be changed. These are: tempo, articulation, pitch, dynamics, brightness, mode, and instrumentation.

EmoteControl V1.0 and V2.0 use Max/MSP, Logic Pro X, and Vienna Symphonic Library (VSL). The interface works with MIDI files inputted in the Max patch, and are played out through a chamber strings synth in the VSL plug-in in Logic. Sliders and buttons control the six (V1.0) or seven (V2.0) cues that can be altered as the music plays in real-time. 

A smaller-scale version of EmoteControl (V1.1) also exists, which allows for changes of five musical cues: tempo, pitch, dynamics, brightness, and mode. This interface utilises Max/MSP and Logic Pro X, however, VSL is swapped with one of Logic's in-house virtual synths. This allows for the interface to work on smaller and less powerful devices. The 'portable' version works with a piano as playout. Four sliders and one toggle (on/off) button control the five cues that can be altered in the smaller-scale interface as the music plays in real-time.
