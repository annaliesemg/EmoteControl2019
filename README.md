# EmoteControl2019

EmoteControl is an interface which allows for live-manipulation of six emotional cues in music: tempo, articulation, pitch, dynamics, brightness, and mode.

EmoteControl utilises Max/MSP, Logic Pro X, and Vienna Symphonic Library (VSL). The interface works with MIDI files inputted in the Max patch, and are played out through a chamber strings synth in the VSL plug-in in Logic. Five sliders and one toggle (on/off) button control the six cues that can be altered as the music plays in real-time.
